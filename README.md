# MELI-repo

MELI is an open-source power system model of the Mexican electricity market, developed to promote skills and understanding of power system planning. 
The model, written in GAMS (General algebraic modeling system) and integrated with Excel, optimizes generation dispatch, investments, and retirements, 
and allows users to input their own assumptions. 

MELI is based on the European Electricity Market Model (EMMA), the Global Energy System Model (GENeSYS-MOD), and the World Bank Electricity Planning Model (EPM) 
and is published under the Creative Commons 3.0 BY-SA License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/), which allows others to share and adapt the 
model for any purpose, as long as appropriate credit is given, and any changes made are indicated. MELI builds upon the work of EMMA, 
which is published under the same license. We would like to acknowledge and thank the developers and contributors of EMMA, GENeSYS-MOD, and EPM for their 
valuable contributions to the field of power sector modelling.

MELI is intended for educational and informational purposes only and has not been peer reviewed. We recommend that users carefully consider the assumptions 
and inputs used in the model and verify the results produced by MELI before making any decisions based on them. Contact us at atovar@energycolab.com for
